[mysql]
1. mac environment, errors like :
    mysql server through socket  tmp mysql.sock
    this may be caused by : mysql db server not started

    solved with the following command(with out 'sudo'):
    /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld &

2. add new field[column] into a table, should delete the file in cache/
    "persistent/myapp_cake_core_method_cache"
    to make the new added field read by cakephp

mysql> select date_add(now(), interval '1,2' YEAR_MONTH);

[put online]
1. make sure all the tables are ready(import new *.sql)
2. remove tmp/cache/...._list  
3. remove tmp/cache/persistent/myapp_cake_core_method_cache
4. change price conf
NOTICE:  2. & 3. should do at the same time when add a new coloum to a table
            when add a new table, 2. will be enough
5. if 2. && 3. not resolved the problem, then do:
    rm tmp/cache/models/*
    rm tmp/cache/persistent/myapp_cake_core_method_cache
